# 🎇 BomBuster

**A haunted playground survival sandbox where bombs are your only friend.**

BomBuster is a fast-paced, sandbox-style survival game set in a creepy abandoned playground. Trapped after dark, a child must survive waves of ghosts using a dangerous bomb launcher — until mom arrives… or something else does.

## 🧠 Premise

A child is left alone in a playground.  
It’s dark.  
Mom is late.  
And the playground is **haunted**.

Armed with a toy-like bomb launcher that fires oversized, burning-thread bombs, you must survive against ghosts that emerge from the shadows of familiar childhood props.

Destroy ghosts.  
Survive the night.
